# Games to Play ON MIDI Controllers
 I've always wanted to play games on a MIDI controller but could never find any online. And developing one myself? Didn't have the time or knowledge—at least, that's what I would've said back in quarantine.
 
 Well, now the tables have turned! (Pun fully intended.)

 Also I "will" add a feature so that at the end of each game, it plays notes according to your presses on the board while playing. 
 
 Feel free to contribute or ask for help – your support is appreciated! I don't accept donations, buy your mom flowers (pls).
 
 A special thanks to public transportation – all of these MIDI-based games were created during my commute in just one week. (I might add more in the future... but probably not.)
 
 I tested all the games and am aware of the bugs but what can you do lol.
